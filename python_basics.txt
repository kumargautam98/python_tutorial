- Installation steps
Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ for your operating system.

1) Open your ``` ~/.zshrc ``` file in any text editor (eg nano on mac). If the file doesn't exist, you can create it. (nano ~/.zshrc)
2) Add the following line to the end of the file: ``` export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:$PATH" ```
3) Save and close the file using the command Ctrl + O on mac, press ENTER key for the confirmation and Ctrl + X for exiting from the nano editor
4) Double check the zshrc file content using the command ``` cat ~/.zshrc ```
5) Next run the source command to make the changes take effect: ``` source ~/.zshrc ```
6) This will prepend the python 3.12 directory to your $PATH, making it the first directory the shell will look in while searching for the 'python3' command. Therefore, 'python3' will now refered to python 3.12 by default.


which python3.10
which python3.11
which python3.12
cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
ls
cd Current
ls -lrt
